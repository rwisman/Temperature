<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>Temperature</i> records, graphs and emails temperature measurements 
	from a <i>thermistor</i> circuit (see below) connected through the iPod/iPhone/iPad 
	headset 
	port. For testing the application, a standard headset jack can be used.</p>
	<p>The application is useful for measuring current temperature or recording 
	temperature changes over a time period.</p>
	<p>Up to two days of temperature measurements can be recorded at rates of 1 to 10 
	samples per second. The measurements are graphed as recorded and can also be 
	emailed. </p>

<p><b>Thermistor Circuit</b></p>

		four-pole jack.</p>

	<p><b>Using the Headset Port</b></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The headset port can serve to interface to devices that produce 
		similar resistance change characteristics to that of the thermistor. For 
		example, ambient light levels can be measured by replacing the 
		thermistor with a light activated photo resistor. </p>
		<p>Designed for audio, the headset port filters DC current inputs and 
		outputs. However, a sine wave with frequency ranging up to 20kHz can be 
		output by a phone app from the headset port to serve as input to the 
		temperature circuit. The amplitude of the returning sine wave output is 
		determined by the resistance of the thermistor. Only the amplitude of 
		the sine wave varies in the circuit, not the frequency. The amplitude of 
		the circuit output is then measured through the headset microphone as 
		a decibel (dB) reading by our phone app . To reduce noise due to 
		sampling errors, a low pass filter is applied to the peak decibel 
		reading of the returning sine wave as measured over a short period of 
		time. Since decibels are already a natural log scale, the relation 
		between dB and temperature will be linear instead of exponential, as 
		seen in the sample data below. A least squares fit to the data gives a 
		straight-line equation that relates the circuit output to other 
		temperatures. Programmed with the equation and calibrated to a 
		temperature on the line, the app can measure temperature. The headset 
		volume control serves to calibrate for individual circuit differences.
		</p>

		<p>The fitted linear equation relates dB to temperature for the 
		thermistor circuit. The plot of temperature (in Celsius) versus peak 
		amplitude from the thermistor in decibels taken for temperatures, 
		respectively, in the freezer compartment of a refrigerator, in ice 
		water, in the refrigerator, in an air-conditioned room, outside during 
		the day, in boiling water.</p>
